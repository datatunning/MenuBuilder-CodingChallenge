# MenuBuilder coding challenge.
You must create all of the classes you think are required to complete the below tasks. Comment and style your code as you would normally.

Create a Hierarchical Menu
Create a Console Application which creates a hierarchical data structure containing a number of objects to represent a menu tree. It should be able to support creating a menu N levels deep. 

Use the example menu below to populate your data structure:

- Administration
	- User Admin
		- Create User
		- Edit User
	- Product Admin
		- All Products
			- My Products
		- Create Product
	- Order Admin
		- Order Reports
			- Audit Reports
				- Updated Orders
				- Created Orders
		- Create Order
- Reports
	- Win Tech Report
	- Microsoft Report

You do not need to implement the actual menu functionality (e.g. you do not need to write code to execute a menu item or like creating a user).

Display a Hierarchical Menu
Using the data structure you created in Part One, output the example menu into the console window formatted to correctly show the menu hierarchy.
